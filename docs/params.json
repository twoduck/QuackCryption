QuackCryption is a novel approach to data structures, app development, and encryption by four, 2nd-semester Purdue University computer science majors. In essence, either text or a file is inputted (along with maybe a passphrase of the user's choosing), the text is encrypted using 128-bit AES (in CBC mode), and then that text is then converted into 'Quack' code. The data encrypted can be decrypted back to its original form, bit-for-bit. \r\n\r\nThe components made are as follows:\r\n* [Backend](https://github.com/Meegul304/DesktopQuackCryption)\r\n* [Android App](https://github.com/scottmangiapane/android-quackcryption)\r\n* Desktop App\r\n* [Web App](https://github.com/scottmangiapane/android-quackcryption/tree/master/website)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Michael Bilstein (@Meegul304) --- Backend\r\n* Kevin Dong (@kevindong) --- Backend and Web App\r\n* Scott Mangiapane (@scottmangiapane) --- Android App and Graphic Design\r\n* Vikram Pasumarti (@vk117) --- Desktop App\r\n\r\n### License\r\nAll rights reserved.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
